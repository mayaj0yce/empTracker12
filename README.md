# empTracker12

## Summary 
By using the MySQL database an employee tracker is made. You can view departments, roles, employees. As well as add new departments, new roles, and new employees, even updating their role if they change departments.
Using seeded data there is a walk through demonstrating each part of the project.

 ### Requirements 
As a user I want to be able to see my employees, their roles, departments, salary, etc in one easy to use application. 
WHEN I follow the steps in the walk through
THEN I am able to view the data I want and add data as needed.

 ### Walk Through
To begin you will want to install the necessary modules. `npm i` // `npm init`
Then start MySQL (my password and username are already stored in a secure .env file that is being ignored in git)
From here seed the schema and the seeds through db/schema.sql and db/seeds.sql

 ### Learning 
I was able to submit this late and it really helped my understanding of other projects and allowed me to have a better grasp of more complex systems we will be working with. 
Learning to use the terminal commands was a little tricky at first but I was able to soon get the hang of it and can now use the ones I memorized in my own coding life. 

 ### Creator 
My name is [MayaJoyce](https://github.com/mayaj0yce) I am currently a bootcamp student learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sequile, MySQL, Node.js, etc. and intend to learn more  about the ins and outs of the other coding languages.
